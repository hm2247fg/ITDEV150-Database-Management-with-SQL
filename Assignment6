Using SQL Functions:  String, Numeric, Date/Time, ISNULL, IIF, CASE, CHOOSE


1.  Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Products table:
  The ListPrice column
  The DiscountPercent column
  A column named DiscountAmount that uses the previous two columns to 
    calculate the discount amount and uses the ROUND function to round the result to 
    2 decimal places

select ListPrice,
	DiscountPercent,
	round(((DiscountPercent / 100) * ListPrice), 2) as DiscountAmount
from Products


2.  Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
  The OrderDate column
  A column that returns the four-digit year that’s stored in the OrderDate 
    column
  A column that returns only the day of the month that’s stored in the 
    OrderDate column.
  A column that returns the result from adding thirty days to the OrderDate 
    column.

select OrderDate,
year(OrderDate) as OrderYear,
day(OrderDate) as DayOnly,
dateadd(day, 30, OrderDate) as DueDate
from Orders


3.  Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
  The CardNumber column
  The length of the CardNumber column
  The last four digits of the CardNumber column
When you get that working right, add the column that follows to the result set. This 
is more difficult because the column requires the use of functions within functions.
  A column that displays the last four digits of the CardNumber column in this 
    format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234. In other words, use Xs for the first 12 digits of 
    the card number and actual numbers for the last four digits of the number.

select
CardNumber,
len(CardNumber) as CardNumberLegnth,
right(CardNumber, 4) as LastFourDigits,
'XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-' + right(CardNumber, 4) as FormattedNumber
from Orders


4.  Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
  The OrderID column
  The OrderDate column
  A column named ApproxShipDate that’s calculated by adding 2 days 
    to the OrderDate column
  The ShipDate column
  A column named DaysToShip that shows the number of days between the 
    order date and the ship date
When you have this working, add a WHERE clause that retrieves just the orders for 
March 2012.

select
OrderID,
OrderDate,
dateadd(day, 2, OrderDate) as AproxShipDate,
ShipDate,
datediff(day, OrderDate, ShipDate) as DaysToShip
from Orders
where month(OrderDate) = 3
and year(OrderDate) = 2012
